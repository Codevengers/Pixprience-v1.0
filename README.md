# Pixprience
Pixprience is a web application that allows users to upload photos along with a note, rating, and title. By extracting the metadata from these photos we are able to visually contextualize these memories for the user by displaying them on either a timeline or a map. In the current version, the user signs in through google and is re-directed to their personal account, in future versions we will incorporate faceook and twitter authentication.
